# FormSubmit.co Setup for Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com

## First-Time Setup (Required)

When someone first submits the form to **Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com**, FormSubmit.co will:

1. **Send a verification email** to Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com
2. The email will say something like: "Confirm your email address to receive form submissions"
3. **The recipient MUST click the verification link** in that email
4. Once verified, all future form submissions will work automatically

## What the Recipient Needs to Do

### Step 1: First Form Submission
- Someone fills out and submits the form on your site
- They'll see a FormSubmit.co confirmation page

### Step 2: Check Email (IMPORTANT!)
- The person with **Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com** needs to:
  1. Check their inbox (and spam folder)
  2. Look for an email from FormSubmit.co
  3. Subject: "Confirm your email address" or similar
  4. **Click the verification link** in that email

### Step 3: Verification Complete
- Once they click the link, FormSubmit.co is activated
- All future form submissions will work immediately
- Emails will be sent directly to Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com

## How to Test Before Going Live

### Option 1: Pre-Verify the Email
1. Go to: https://formsubmit.co
2. Enter: Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com
3. Click "Get Started" or similar
4. Check Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com inbox
5. Click verification link
6. Now the form will work immediately!

### Option 2: Test Submission
1. Submit a test form (use `test-email.html`)
2. Check Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com for verification email
3. Click verification link
4. Submit another test - should work now!

## What Happens After Verification

✅ **After verification:**
- Form submissions work immediately
- Emails arrive within 1-2 minutes
- No further setup needed
- Works forever (unless email is changed)

❌ **Before verification:**
- Form submits successfully
- But email is NOT sent
- Recipient gets verification email instead
- Must verify to activate

## Important Notes

- **Only needs to be done once** per email address
- **Verification link expires** (usually 24-48 hours)
- If expired, just submit form again to get new verification email
- **Check spam folder** - verification email might go there

## Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] Form is live on your site
- [ ] Someone submits the form (or you test it)
- [ ] Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com receives verification email
- [ ] Recipient clicks verification link
- [ ] Form is now active and working!

## Troubleshooting

**"I never received the verification email"**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Try submitting form again
- Verify email address is correct: Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com

**"I clicked the link but it's not working"**
- Link might have expired (submit form again for new link)
- Make sure you clicked the full link
- Try in a different browser

**"Form submits but no email arrives"**
- Check if email was verified (submit test form to trigger verification)
- Check spam folder
- Wait 2-3 minutes (sometimes delayed)

## Alternative: Pre-Verify Before Launch

To avoid the verification step for users, you can:

1. Submit a test form yourself first
2. Have Info.bigfishdarts@gmail.com verify the email
3. Then launch your site - form will work immediately for all users

This way, when real users submit the form, emails will work right away!
